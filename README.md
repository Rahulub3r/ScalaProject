# Spark Data Munging

The purpose of the project is to use spark to load and query different views from the [CollegeScore card data](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/). Please download the data first and add it in the resources directory to use it.

Different things implemented were as follows:
1. Loading data into spark session
2. Finding few top expensive schools
3. Finding schools in Texas where student debt is most
4. Calculating statistics of completion rate of schools grouped by city
